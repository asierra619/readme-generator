# ReadMe Generator

## Description

The README Generator was made to make things easier for fellow developers, new and old. Feeling lazy? Run the program to speed things up. Like consistency across your projects? Run the program for uniform results. This project is a simple tool that makes life a little simpler. It solves the problem of having to format your README.md and does the dirty work for you. 

What I learned in the process is how to use Node.js and I became more comfortable with intergrated terminals as well. In general, I am slowly becoming more comfortable with JavaScript as a whole.

## Installation

After downloaded the repo, open the intergrated terminal. enter <npm i> in the terminal to install all dependencies (inquirer@8.2.4). Once installed, enter <node index.js> to run the program.

## Usage

As stated above, once installed, type <node index.js> into the intergrated terminal to begin the program. Answer the questions as they are presented to generate a clean README.md.
